1. What is a method?
- A named sequence of statements. (A named space in memory that points to a block of code that accepts and optionally returns a value).
2. What does a return statement do?
- Returns information from a method.
3. What is an expression bodied method?
- Uses => operator to reference the expression that forms the body.
4. What is the scope of a variable?
- region of a program where that variable is accessible.
5. What is an overloaded method?
- Two identifiers that have the same name and are declared in the same scope.
6. How do you call a method that requires arguments?
- You must supply an argument for each parameter.
7. How do you write a method, that is, specify the method definition, that requires a parameter list?
- You call the named method and supply a comma-seperated list of arguments.
8. How do you specify a parameter as optional when defining a method?
- providing a default value to a parameter within a method.
9. How do you pass a argument to a method as a named parameter?
- Specify the name of the parameter followed by a semi-colon and a value to be used.
10. How do you return values from a method? Can you return multiple values from a method, and if so,
how?
- By using the return statement, yes, by returning a tuple.
11. How does the compiler resolve any ambiguity between named arguments and optional parameters?
- Calls the method with the named parameter from the named argument, selects the optional parameter that most closely resembles the argument.
