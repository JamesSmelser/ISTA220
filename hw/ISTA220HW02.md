# C# Programming Homework 02
## Chapter 02, C# Step by Step
### 1 Homework
#### 1.1 Readings
##### Read chapter 2 in the C# Step by Step book.
###### 1.2 Discussion Questions
###### Answer the discussion questions in writing for chapter 2.
1. What is a local variable?
- a variable that exists only in a method or another small section of code.
2. What is a statement?
- a command that performs an action.
3. What is an identifier?
- known as keywords, Examples of keywords are class, namespace, and using.
4. What is a variable?
- a named location in memory that contains a value.
5. What is a method?
- a named sequence of statements.
6. Are primitive types and value types the same thing? This is not in the book.
- Yes, value types hold the value of variable directly on its own memory space, primitive data are int, string, object, short, char, float, double, char, bool.
7. How are arithmetic operators and variable types related?
- arithmetic operators are used to allow add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder operations to variables as well as concatenate string variables.
8. How do you turn an integer into a string?
- .ToString()
9. How do you turn a string into an integer?
- int.Parse
10. What is the difference between precedence and associativity? Give an example where this makes a
difference.
- precedence requires the values to be evaluated first, associativity is evaluated left to right. 2+3*5=17, (2+3)x5=25.
11. What is the definite assignment rule?
- a variable must have a value before it is read.
12. How are the prex and postx increment and decrement operators evaluated differently?
- prefix is evaluated before and postfix is evaluated after the value.
13. What is string interpolation?
- used in concatenating strings instead of +.
14. What does the var keyword do?
- allows the .NET framework to assign a data type to a variable based on the value.
